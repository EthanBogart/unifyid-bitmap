# unifyid-bitmap
A solution to the UnifyID technical challenge

This application is intended to create a random bitmap from the Random.org api. Unfortunately, I ran over my quota while testing, so I continued by using the Math.random function. However, this should work just fine now.

## To run
To run this program, just use `npm install` or `yarn install` and then run `node RandomBitmap.js` inside the project root.
